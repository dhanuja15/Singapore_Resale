# Singapore_Resale
Resale Price Prediction Project
Overview:
This project focuses on predicting resale prices of housing units using Random Forest Regression. The dataset contains information on various attributes of properties such as town, flat type, floor area, and resale price.

Data Sources:
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/189/view]. It includes historical transaction data of residential properties, captured from [1990] to [2024], in [Singapore].

Methods Used:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Modeling: Random Forest Regression to predict resale prices.
Evaluation: Performance metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) Score.
Dependencies:
Python (version x.x.x)
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
Files:
data.csv: Raw dataset containing property information.
preprocessing.py: Python script for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
random_forest_model.py: Python script for building and evaluating the Random Forest Regression model.
requirements.txt: List of required libraries and their versions.
Instructions:
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run preprocessing.py to preprocess the data.
Run random_forest_model.py to train the Random Forest Regression model and evaluate its performance.
Results:
Random Forest Regression Model:
MAE: [value]
MSE: [value]
RMSE: [value]
R-squared: [value]
Future Improvements:
Tuning hyperparameters of the Random Forest model for better performance.
Exploring other regression algorithms for comparison.
